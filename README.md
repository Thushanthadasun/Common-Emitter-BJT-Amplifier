This project explores the design and analysis of a common-emitter BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) amplifier circuit, focusing on key performance metrics such as voltage gain, bandwidth, and input/output impedances under realistic design constraints. The circuit is engineered to achieve a voltage gain of 170 and a bandwidth of 8 MHz. Through detailed calculations, simulations using Proteus, and practical implementation, this work enhances the understanding of analog circuit design principles and their application in real-world engineering scenarios.
